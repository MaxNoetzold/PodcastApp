# PodcastApp
This project is a website that allows you to stream podcasts (or any audio) only to authenticated users. It is a PWA, so you can even "install" it on your device. All core functionalities are working offline as well. The users can download the podcast episodes manually and browse through them and listen to them offline. The audio files are encoded as HLS (for ios) and DASH (for everyone else) streams and brought to the user with the help of the shaka-player API. Additionally, every podcast episode has its own comments section, which got inspired by Discord chat channels. All the data (for example, the podcasts metadata or the user-data) gets stored in a MongoDB Database. In addition to the general authentication, the admins can define user groups (named filterBubbles in the code) and assign podcast categories to these bubbles.
